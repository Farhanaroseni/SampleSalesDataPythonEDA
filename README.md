# Sample Sales Data Analysis

## Introduction
This project analyzes a sample sales dataset obtained from Kaggle. It includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python and a dynamic sales dashboard created in Tableau. The goal is to extract insights from the sales data and visualize them effectively.

## About Dataset
Sample Sales Data, Order Info, Sales, Customer, Shipping, etc., Used for Segmentation, Customer Analytics, Clustering and More. Inspired for retail analytics. This was originally used for Pentaho DI Kettle, But I found the set could be useful for Sales Simulation training.
